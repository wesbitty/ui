## Wesbitty Ui

[Wesbitty Ui](https://www.npmjs.com/wesbitty/ui) Makes it super easy building UI components and the ability to develop components independently of one another without the need to have mock data in a database. 

[Wesbitty Ui](https://www.npmjs.com/wesbitty/ui) is develop with [Npm PackageManager](https://www.npmjs.com/) and it's a [React](https://reactjs.org/) Ui library.

### Installation

```cli
npm install @wesbitty/ui
```

### Usage

Example of importing a component

```js
import { Button } from '@wesbitty/ui'

//...

return <Button>Get started</Button>
```

### Using Icons

We use [Feather icon library](https://feathericons.com/) in [Wesbitty UI](https://www.npmjs.com/wesbitty/ui)

You can use any Icon from the library as a component by prepending `Icon` to any Icon name, like, `<IconMail>`

```js
import { IconMail } from '@wesbitty/ui'

//...

return <IconMail size="small" />
```
